      <p>This blog was supposed to be a database for to people find books at the intersection of unique topics in the social sciences. However, I realized that I missed reading and exploring books for fun, and also needed time to understand whether this was a product people needed. I also found myself generating interest in a wide variety of fields over the course of my MA, and building a product became the least of my concerns. I just really love books and need an excuse to talk about them all the time (as if I needed one).</p>
<h4 id="what-youll-find-here">What you’ll find here <a href="#what-youll-find-here" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><ol>
<li>Rapid reviews of three to five books</li>
<li>Book reviews for individual books (once a month)</li>
<li>Topical reading lists including 1-2 books, articles and grey literature</li>
<li>Bonus content</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="my-current-interests-as-of-april-2024">My current interests (as of April 2024!) <a href="#my-current-interests-as-of-april-2024" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>I am generally interested in reading anything interesting in the social sciences, but am inclined towards sociopolitical accounts of day-to-day life in African countries. Some of the domains I have been reading around recently are science and technology studies and development studies, mostly because of the work I have been doing for my Master’s research output. There is a world of texts out there but very few people engaging with them outside academia. One of my objectives with this blog is to contribute to breaking this wall and encouraging conversations about these texts that include people outside academia.</p>
<h4 id="whats-next">What’s next? <a href="#whats-next" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>A book review, and hopefully some great conversations about the text as I develop this blog. Thank you for reading!</p>
