    <div class="content">
      <p>I stumbled upon science and technology studies (STS) during my Masters programme (studying International Development Studies). My research topic shifted from an examination of female health workers‚Äô experiences during Covid-19 to ed tech in Africa. Don‚Äôt ask me how I made the switch! I had long been interested in various dimensions of science and technology. I grew up aspiring to become a NASA astronaut (again, don‚Äôt ask me how I became a social scientist), and was enthralled by Silicon Valley stories as the wave of swindler-founders rose in the 2010s. Finding STS felt like finding a place where my varying interests in this field - in social media, beauty politics, techno-politics and aid - could be coherently expressed. I am especially interested in techno-politics (how politics and technology interact to shape systems of governance and societal processes) as I watched technology transform the way we lived beginning 2020.</p>
<p>I found that the development industry rarely turns the lens on itself regarding the adoption and spread of technological solutions, despite the significant influence that tech founders have had on the field for the last few decades. Moreover, I think science and technology in Africa could be more critically theorized, at least from the lens of techno-politics and sociocultural impact. The narrative about technology in Africa is often optimistic, but whose ideas shape that optimism and how has that come to be? This one question influenced my foray into educational technology on the continent, and also encouraged me to explore the literature on STS in Africa. This is easily one of my favourite subject areas to discuss, and I am excited to share this reading list!</p>
<h1 id="books">Books <a href="#books" class="anchor">üîó</a></h1><ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533904/what-do-science-technology-and-innovation-mean-from-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Do Science, Technology, and Innovation Mean from Africa?</a>¬†(Clapperton Chakanetsa Mavhunga)
If you read nothing at all from this list, read this and Mavhunga‚Äôs work. Arguably one of the leading theorists of STS in Africa, Mavhunga‚Äôs collection redefines what technology means for Africans, with emphasis on indigenous forms of knowledge that have long been left out of theorization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.atomicjunction.com/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Junction: Nuclear Power in Africa after Independence</a>¬†(Abena Dove Osseo-Asare)<br>
On my to-read list, after I read about British involvement in Ghana‚Äôs nuclear program after Nkrumah was deposed. Osseo-Asare discusses the Los Alamos-esque endeavour undertaken at Atomic Junction by bright-eyed, Soviet-trained Ghanaian scientists, and tensions over placemaking with residents of the settlement. An excerpt is available on the linked website.</p>

<p><a href="https://iupress.org/9780253023070/ghana-on-the-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana On the Go: African Mobility in the Age of Motor Transportation</a>¬†(Jennifer Hart)<br>
I found this book while looking for analyses of trotro and lorries in Ghana, for a review of¬†<em>Kukurantumi - Road to Accra</em>. There‚Äôs surprisingly very little in the literature that seriously examines the iconography of these forms of transit in Ghana‚Äôs political history. This book traces the history of commercial transportation in Ghana, specifically focusing on how trotro drivers navigated (post-)colonial realities to carve out distinct social and economic identities undergirded by local interpretations of modernity. I loved the use of primary sources in this book.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo10444942.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Africa as a Living Laboratory: Empire, Development, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870-1950</a>¬†(Helen Tilley)<br>
This book is a tremendous resource if you want to understand how various colonial actors (state, philanthropic and academic) shaped the development of scientific knowledge in Africa. It also looks at how Africans, as knowledge creators, influenced these external efforts to ‚Äògovern‚Äô Africa better through scientific inquiry. This is a very well-researched book packed with case studies and source material.</p>
