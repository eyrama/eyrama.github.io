Eyram Agbe is a Development Studies M.A. candidate at York University. Her research focuses on "development from below" in urban Ghana, specifically the ways that communities in Accra have mobilized to support reopening efforts across the city. Eyram's M.A. research specifically explores the various strategies that basic school administrators in Accra have developed (in tandem with neighbouring communities) to support academic continuity for students, and mitigate transmission of Covid-19 among students and staff.
